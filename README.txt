# Creating a QR-Code

##Usage

1. Enter you message in the 'qr_aim.txt' file and save it
2. Run the python file 'qr.py' by typing 'python3 qr.py' and hitting the 'Enter' button
3. Enter the name of the png file which is going to contain the QR-Code and hit 'Enter' 
4. Finish

###Example

The text file 'qr_aim.txt' says: "Hello, what is your name?".
Next I execute following command 'python3 qr.py' and enter the name of my QR-Code 'QR1' and hit 'Enter'.
If I type 'ls' I will see the new file 'QR1.png'. That file is the the image of the QR-Code which I can scan now.
